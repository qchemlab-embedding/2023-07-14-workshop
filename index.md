# Prerequisites - please prepare in advance:

* on the Ares cluster:

  * set up your ssh on Ares:
    * generate ssh keys (e.g., follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key))
    * then, add the generated key to GitHub (e.g., follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account))

  * prepare a working space on the Ares cluster:
    * make a directory in which you want to run tests
    * clone [this repository](https://github.com/qchemlab-embedding/2023-07-14-workshop-exercises) to your test directory


* if you want to have the exercises on your laptop:

  * repeat the steps above (but on your laptop)

  * if you want to have `DIRAC` installed on your local machine:
    * you can download the recent release
    * if you are interested in the `DIRAC` code development, please let me know
