## Running FDE calculations in ADF

- Please go through [these examples in `ADF`](https://www.scm.com/doc/ADF/Examples/Examples.html#fde-frozen-density-embedding), see whether you can run them successfully on Ares

- Tasks/Questions:
  - for one selected example, see how do the FDE results compare to the supermolecular results
  - do you see how to run freeze-and-thaw cycles (look for "RELAX" keyword)? Does it improve the prediction?
