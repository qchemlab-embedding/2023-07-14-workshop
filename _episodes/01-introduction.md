title: Quantum mechanical description of molecular systems - a gentle introduction
teaching: 30
exercises: 0
questions:
  - How do we model molecular systems with ab-initio methods?
  - What are the assets of ab-inition QM modeling, what are the constraints?
  - How does that relate to the project we work on?
  - What will we (specifically) focus on in our calculations?
objectives:
  - Discuss the difference between the physics and the models.
  - Discuss various approximations and their implications.
  - Make sure everyone has a basic notion of what the project is about and what is to calculate.

## The project we work on



**relativistic effects**
**molecular properties**
**environmental effects**
**frozen density embedding**


In this lesson, we dismantle each keyword.



## The essence of ab-initio quantum chemistry modeling

### Physical reality vs theoretical models

- **physics:**  
  - molecules as sets of particles (nuclei + electrons), which are in constant motion and interact (with other particles and external fields)
- **modeling:** 
  - molecular modeling as a many-body problem -> need for approximations
  - approximations often determine which physical effects are captured in a model (examples below)

- purpose of theoretical modeling:
  - $\hat{H} \psi = E \psi$



### Quantum chemistry models


- 'typical' approximations:
  - fix nuclei in space: describe electrons only (Born-Oppenheimer approximation)
  - describe one electron in an effective field of other electrons (one-electron approximation)


- what comprises the model (within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation):
  - how is one electron described
    - "the basis set"
    - examples:
  - how are many electrons described
    - "the method"
    - examples:
  - how is physics described (particle motion and interactions):
    - the Hamiltonian
    - examples:


- examples:
  - **relativistic effects**: modeled as the difference (e.g. on the total energy) between the description with and without these effects included in the Hamiltonian
  - **electron correlation effects**:
